A Power BI dashboard for Griffith College could provide a comprehensive overview of user engagement metrics. This dashboard would include visualizations tracking trends in user activity over time, such as the number of new users and overall engagement rates. It would also feature insights into specific areas of engagement, including content engagement with different types of resources like articles and videos, wellness assessments capturing student well-being, program engagement highlighting enrollment and completion rates, chat engagement metrics such as response times and satisfaction ratings, notification engagement tracking open and click-through rates, and survey engagement displaying response rates and satisfaction scores. By presenting these key metrics in an easily digestible format, stakeholders can quickly assess the effectiveness of Griffith College's digital platforms and services, allowing for data-driven decisions to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
