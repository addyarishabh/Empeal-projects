# Grifith College Dashboard
To create dashboards for Griffith College encompassing user trends, overall engagement, content engagement, wellness assessment, program engagement, chat engagement, notification engagement, and survey engagement, the process involves integrating data from various sources such as user activity logs, wellness surveys, program enrollment records, chat transcripts, notification logs, and survey responses. Each dashboard component will focus on specific metrics relevant to its respective category. For instance, the user trend dashboard may display a line chart illustrating user growth over time. Meanwhile, the content engagement dashboard could feature pie charts showcasing the distribution of user interactions across different content types. The wellness assessment dashboard might present radar charts depicting student well-being scores. Program engagement could involve bar charts comparing enrollment rates across different courses. Chat engagement metrics, such as response times and satisfaction ratings, could be visualized through scatter plots or stacked bar charts. Notification engagement might be presented through funnel charts tracking open and click-through rates. Finally, the survey engagement dashboard may utilize donut charts to display response rates by survey topic. By tailoring each dashboard to focus on specific aspects of engagement, stakeholders can gain comprehensive insights into user behavior and satisfaction levels, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes within Griffith College.
